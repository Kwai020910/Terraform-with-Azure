Here is a Terraform module that can be used to create an Azure resource group and storage account.

# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "my_resource_group" {
  name = "my-resource-group"
  location = "westus2"
}

# Create a storage account
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "my_storage_account" {
  name = "my-storage-account"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.my_resource_group.name
  location = azurerm_resource_group.my_resource_group.location
  account_tier = "Standard"
  account_kind = "StorageV2"
} 
To use this module, you will need to have the following installed:

Terraform
The AzureRM provider for Terraform

Once you have these installed, you can create a new directory for your project and save the above code in a file called main.tf. Then, you can initialize Terraform and run the plan:

terraform init
terraform plan 


This will show you the changes that Terraform will make. To apply the changes, run the following command:

terraform apply 

This will create the resource group and storage account. You can then verify that they were created by running the following command:

terraform output 

This will show you the output of the module, which will include the name and location of the resource group and storage account.
